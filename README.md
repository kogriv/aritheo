Advanced arithmetic and number theory resources

Higher arithmetic refers to the branch of mathematics that studies integers and their properties. Key topics in higher arithmetic include:

1. **Number Theory**: The study of properties of integers, such as divisibility, prime numbers, remainders, and comparisons.

2. **Diophantine Equations**: Equations for which integer solutions are sought. For example, the equation $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$ has integer solutions like (3, 4, 5).

3. **Quadratic and Cubic Residues**: The study of remainders when divided by prime numbers.

4. **Factorization**: Expressing integers as a product of prime numbers.

5. **Modular Arithmetic**: The study of numbers under a modulus, where numbers are compared based on their remainders.

6. **Fermat's Theorem, Euler's Theorem, Wilson's Theorem**: Classic results related to prime numbers and divisibility.

7. **Arithmetic Functions**: For example, Euler's function, which counts the number of integers that are coprime to a given number.

Higher arithmetic is a fundamental part of number theory that deals with the properties and behaviors of integers.
